1) What does null=True/False do?


2) Usually operates on multiple rows in the table

class BookManager(models.Manager):
    def create_book(self, title):
        book = self.create(title=title)
        # do something with the book
        return book

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    objects = BookManager()

>>book = Book.objects.create_book("Pride and Prejudice")


3) Definitions in your Classes: control getting information from individual instances

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    birth_date = models.DateField()
    address = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    city = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    state =  # Yes, this is U.S.-centric...

    def baby_boomer_status(self):
        "Returns the person's baby-boomer status."
        import datetime
        if datetime.date(1945, 8, 1) <= self.birth_date <= datetime.date(1964, 12, 31):
            return "Baby boomer"
        if self.birth_date < datetime.date(1945, 8, 1):
            return "Pre-boomer"
        return "Post-boomer"

    def is_midwestern(self):
        "Returns True if this person is from the Midwest."
        return self.state in ('IL', 'WI', 'MI', 'IN', 'OH', 'IA', 'MO')
        
4) WHAT IS THIS ALL THIS SHIT
model.py
    a) in the class/object: methods/functions that operate on a specific row/instance
    b) in the modelManager: how to construct an object; methods/functions that operate on all rows/instances
    c) in modelForms: these help people submit data easily to the DB (logic like validation, display type, etc

logic.py
    a) takes data from the model and the models functions to provide the view with appropriate information

views.py
    a) displays information according to url
